# File Commit History

### Overview

The File Commit History feature allows users to explore the commit history of a specific file within a Github repository. By providing the link to a Github repository and specifying a file path, users can delve into the evolution of the file, examining each commit that has modified it.

### Why It's Useful

- **Historical Insight**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of how a file has evolved over time, including changes made in each commit.

- **Blame Analysis**: Determine who made specific changes to the file and when, facilitating accountability and collaboration.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the reasons behind changes by linking them to specific commits and their messages.

- **Iterative Exploration**: For files with extensive commit histories, users can explore the history iteratively, focusing on specific periods or changes of interest.

- **Commit Details**: Delve deeper into the commit details using the [Commit Details](/features/commits/commit-details) feature.

In this example, we analyze the commit history of the [UnsafeAccessorAttribute.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/UnsafeAccessorAttribute.cs) file in the [.NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repository. After retrieving the commit history, we delve deeper into the specific commit we are interested in.

### Conclusion

The `File Commit History` feature enhances the Github repositories analysis, offering users a detailed and insightful look into the history of individual files. This feature is particularly useful for developers, project managers, and anyone interested in understanding the evolution of a project's codebase.
